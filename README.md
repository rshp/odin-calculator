This is a small calculator done as final foundations course project
It does not follow the couse guidelines:
1. A small parser has been written to scan the input expression and evaluate it.
2. Most of incorrect entries, i.e. missing parentheses, operands, multiple decimal points are handelded by JS string conversion returning NaN.
3. The goal was to make calculator an object by itself with all functionality defined in its methods
